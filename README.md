## Flagex

- This is a quiz site made with django 
- It gives the country name and the user should select the Flag of the specified Country 
- And at the end your score will be displayed and you can proceed saving your progress

## Note

- The icon file and the Flag.zip files should be inside the Static folder due to large number of files i inserted them as a zip file
- The database files are already migrated so i case of new use it should be modified correctly 

## Websites Link

- I named it Flagex it means Flagexplorer ,Here's the [Website](https://flagex.pythonanywhere.com/) 
- I hosted it for free in pythonanywhere because its a test project not a fully developed one
