## Flagex

- This is a quiz site made with django 
- It gives the country name and the user should select the Flag of the specified Country 
- And at the end your score will be displayed and you can proceed saving your progress

## Note

- The icon file and the Flag.zip files should be inside the Static folder due to large number of files i inserted them as a zip file

## Websites Link

- Here's the [Site](https://flagex.pythonanywhere.com/) 
- i hosted it for free in pythonanywhere because its a test project not a fully developed one 

## Help
